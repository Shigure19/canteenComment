# Flowey

Today is Mid-Autumn Festival but I am not able to enjoy the holiday. The whole day is just under the shadow--I did not come back home and there is nothing attracting me happened. It is 8 P.M., the day have been passing. Suddenly, someone is messaging me for presenting me a mooncake. She is a girl I met in some job, named Flowey by me.

It is unnecessary to describe Flowey with complex sentences. Flowey, a lovely girl, who has a little round face like the shape of a cobblestone and curly hair, is used to have her hair put up, wear a baby blue dress and a pair of small leather shoes. She always smiles with twlinkling eyes when she meets me. I used to talk about her with my mother when I just knew her. Mom commented, *"A little short girl with tender appearance."* after seeing her photos.

Flowey treats the life motivatedly with her innocence. She is like a sunflower who often turns her face to the sun. It is the origin of the nickname "Flowey", from "SunFlowey" which is a little awkward for her mouth. I love Flowey deeply, maybe because of her appearance in the abyss of my life, or since she always tries her best to persuade me back whenever I have a hard time, or just because **Flowey is lovely, lovely and so lovely……**

However, in September of the last year, from about the Mid-Autumn 
 holidays, I did not contact her anymore. It was not until one day in the next semester that I contacted with her with courage. In this way, during the semester when the school kept out, I met her twice again. With a little surprise, I was relieved for that she forgot what I had done. Needless to say, **Flowey are still so lovely.**

Time goes quickly. After the boring summer holiday, everyone moved to Xuhui campus. Then after another several days, the Mid-Autumn Festival came again.

She arrived my dormitory and stood tiptoe at the edge of the flowerbed. She was looking around for me. When I arrived in the face of her, I felt that nothing was changed--her smile, twinkling eyes and even her length--the "little short girl" still needs to look up to me. Though I ought to take the mooncake back to the room directly, I accompanied her to go back to her dormitory. I talked with her as peep at her while I was thinking: **Flowey is still so lovely.**

After a relucant farewell, I went back finally. In my room, I opened the tissue packing the mooncake, then put them on the desk and cut it into four pieces. It also has the pattern of flower, contains pink filling in the pale gold cake skin, just like the precious memories. Tasted soft, it was like a dish of delicate dessert instead of certain traditional production which brings customers a greasy feeling. With time gone, the four pieces were consumed. The complex flavour has passed away, therefore, there was only the sweet aftertaste.

The aftertaste has been falling gradually. What I could still feel is the fragrance left over my fingers from her. It is known that the fragrance will also fall after washing--any substrance will be resolved,  but the feeling between us is still firm ever, never broken. The day, which should have only white and black, was coloured in a moment by Flowey's appearance.

The life, which should have also only white and black, is colourful due to Flowey's existance.
